We are a group of scientists with diverse backgrounds and are interested in cool evolutionary stuff! We met at the 2019 [SFI Complex Systems Summer School]() -- the Pheno-evo model was a result of conversations we had there about microbial evolution. Our goal is to use this model to study the evolution of phenotypic diversity in microbes in two-dimensional space.
