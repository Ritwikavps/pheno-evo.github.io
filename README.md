We are a group of scientists with diverse backgrounds and are interested in cool evolutionary stuff! We met at the 2019 [SFI Complex Systems Summer School](https://www.santafe.edu/engage/learn/schools/sfi-complex-systems-summer-school) -- the Pheno-Evo Project was a result of conversations we had there about microbial evolution. Our goal is to use this model to study the evolution of phenotypic diversity in microbes in two-dimensional space.

### Why is this interesting?

Microbes are generally thought of as simple, straight-forward model organisms. 

### What are we trying to do?



### What tools are we using to do this?

You can find information about our NetLogo model [here](https://ritwikavps.github.io/pheno-evo.github.io/netlogomodel).

If you don't have NetLogo on your computer, you can interact with a web version of our model [right here!](https://ritwikavps.github.io/pheno-evo.github.io/pheno-evo_web.html)
