We've created an R package to help you analyze and visualize the complicated data generated by a Pheno-Evo experiment. 
You can install it directly from GitHub using the devtools package:

install.packages("devtools") # only if you don't already have devtools installed!
devtools::github_install("jessicaaudreylee/PhenoEvoR)
