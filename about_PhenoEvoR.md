# PhenoEvoR: the R package for Pheno-Evo data

## How do I get it?
You can install it directly from GitHub with the [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) package, using the following commands within R:

    install.packages("devtools") # only if you don't already have devtools installed!
    devtools::github_install("jessicaaudreylee/PhenoEvoR")

## What is it?
It contains all the functions you need to get from the BehaviorSpace output table to plots that summarize temporal and spatial dynamics of your model populations. [Check out our vignette here](https://ritwikavps.github.io/pheno-evo.github.io/PhenoEvoR-intro-vignette).

**For use with the vignette, you'll want to download this example dataset: [PhenoEvo_Example_experiment.csv.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u7aGSetxyY_kgFrck03udQt7sggRxQfA/view?usp=sharing)**
This was generated from an unrealistically small experiment, as described in our Pheno-Evo tutorial. But it contains all the components you need to test out the PhenoEvoR analyses. It is a 345MB zipped CSV file.

## What could we do better?
Most datasets generated by Pheno-Evo experiments will be pretty sizeable (several GB), and we realize we haven't discussed much in the way of good techniques to manage that. We're still working it out ourselves.
This is our first release! We would love to hear from you if you find our materials useful and/or if you have any comments or questions.
